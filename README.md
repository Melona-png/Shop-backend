# E Commerce Website Backend
This is the backend for an e-commerce website written using MySQL and JavaScript, and utilizing API routes through Express.js. This repository contains the code for the server that handles all the database-related operations.

## Tools Used
The backend is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
MySQL: Relational database management system used to store and manage data
Sequelize: Promise-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js
Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Make sure you have Node.js and MySQL installed on your system. You will also need to create a MySQL database and provide the database configuration in the config/config.json file.

You should now be able to start the server using npm start. The server will listen on port 3001 by default.

## Modifying the Code
The code for the server is located in the src folder. The models folder contains the Sequelize models for the database tables. The routes folder contains the API routes that handle incoming requests. The controllers folder contains the logic for handling the requests.


## Testing the API
You can test the API using a tool like Postman. Send requests to the API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.

## Conclusion
This backend provides a foundation for building a robust e-commerce website. By utilizing technologies like MySQL, JavaScript, and Express.js, you can create an API that can handle a high volume of traffic and provide a seamless experience for your users.
